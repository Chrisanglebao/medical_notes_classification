Classify notes into clinical domains
In this assignment, we will label the medical notes samples into one of five clinical domains. Each medical note comes from exactly one of the following five clinical domains:

Gastroenterology
Neurology
Orthopedic
Radiology
Urology

The training and test datasets are not uniformly distributed across these domains -- i.e. some domains are represented more often than others in both training and test datasets. The training dataset consists of medical notes, one note per file. The notes have some structure, but mostly consists of the procedure conducted.
